This is my Web Application...<br>
I created this simple website as my second assessment for UOM..<br>
Here How I made my CEYLON SPICES web site<br><br>
 Header Section<br>
  When I got start,I didnt have any idea for how to create this section.<br>
  so i browsed some websites and searched You tube.<br>
  Then I got some idea about this section.<br>
  First,I had to add a main nevigations for my web site.so i choosed them as <br>
  01.Home,<br>
  02.Sign in<br>
  03.Shop<br>
  04.Cart and last 05.About Us section.<br><br>
  
 Search Bar<br>
 After I created the header section I added the search bar.I added this only to home & shop sections.<br>
 because I thinked , when the user come to our web site,they will see our home page.<br>
 So they usually dont go to sign in or other page to start searching. <br>
<br>
 Footer <br>
  I created a responsive footer.<br>
  When the user move his mouse to the linked texts ,<br> 
  the white colour change  in to the black and also the text padding left 5px.<br><br>

 Atter That , I desided to create my other main pages.<br>And I created them.<br>
 When I created the sign in page i got more troubles because it had to include 3 css pages
 so the problum was two of them had the same property values and classes.<br>
 That was a big mistake but finally i could fixed it.
 <br><br>
 Home Page<br>
  I created my home page with four listed items.When the user click on each item's name , <br>
  the user will redirect to the exact item listed in shop page.
 <br><br>
 Sign In Page<br>
  This was the headerst page.<br><br>
  Those links in login form are linked it self.<br>I didnt create a sign up form because it needs to have
  My SQL to store the data.<br><br>
 
 Shop Page<br>
  I created the shop page with four list items.<br>
  Each item has a title , small description , price , review stars and buy now button.<br>
  When the user clicks the buy now botton it will redirect the user in to the same shop page but 
  theres only show the exact item and it's description.<br>
  There is a Add To Your Cart button and when user click that button, 
  it redirect to the cart page.<br><br>
  
 Cart page<br>
  Normaly , the cart page is empty.<br>
  But the user click items on Home page or the shop page then redirected cart page shows the items and infromations.<br><br>
  
 About Us <br>
  There are 8  # hyperlinks on this section 
  When the user click About us or other texts on footer section it will redirect 
  to the about us page.
  <br><br>
  This is how I made my first Web site using Html,CSS and JS.<br>
  
 Total HTML documents = 14<br>
       CSS documents  = 08<br>
	   Hyperlinks Header Navigation          =6*5                  = 30<br>
	              Footer                     =(12*5)+(12*4)+(12*4) =156<br>
				  Listed Items (Home page)   =                        4<br>
				  Listed Items (Shop page)   =                        4<br>
				  Cart                       =                        4<br>
				  Total Hyperlinks           =                     = 198<br>
				  
	   Images                                = 12<br>
	   Animations For Hover                  =37<br>
	   Js Code                               = 09<br>
	   Table                                 = 01<br>
	   list  (ul)                            = 55<br>
